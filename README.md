Introduction

BlenderProc is a synthetic data generator that helps the process of training a neural network by reducing the amount of manual data collection required. This tool allows for easy modifications of data, such as noise creation (new objects and different backgrounds).

Pros

Reduces manual data collection requirements

Enables easy data variation and modification

Accelerates neural network training processes

Provides controlled testing environments

Cons

Performance degradation due to sim2real gap

Does not replicate the real world accurately

Requires time and attention, steep learning curve

Installation and Setup

Environment Setup

To avoid conflicts and damage, create a dedicated conda environment:

Anaconda Installation Guide

# Create new environment with Python 3.10
conda create --name blenderproc python=3.10

# Activate the environment
conda activate blenderproc

# To exit the environment
conda deactivate

# Go inside your blenderproc folder inside the environment
cd your/path/to/env

BlenderProc Installation

Method 1: pip Installation

pip install blenderproc

Since I had some problems with pip, I suggest using Git to install the full repository.

Method 2: Git Installation

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DLR-RM/BlenderProc

# Navigate to the folder
cd BlenderProc

# Install all the dependencies
pip install -e .

Quick Start

I highly recommend starting with the example they provide.Note: BlenderProc will automatically install Blender 4.2. Installation time depends on network speed.

Basic BlenderProc Script Structure

Essential Components

A basic BlenderProc script has five main components:

Scene Setup

Noise Adding

Light Addition

Camera Alignment

Output Rendering

Complete Basic Script

import blenderproc as bproc
import numpy as np

# Initialize blenderproc
bproc.init()

# Load an object
objs = bproc.loader.load_obj("path/to/model.obj")

# Randomize object pose to add noise to the scene
for obj in objs:
    obj.set_location(np.random.uniform(-1, 1, size=3))
    obj.set_rotation_euler(np.random.uniform(0, np.pi*2, size=3))

# Add light to your scene
light = bproc.types.Light()
light.set_location([2, -2, 2])
light.set_energy(np.random.uniform(100, 500))

# Define camera poses with transformation matrix
cam_pose = bproc.math.build_transformation_mat(
    [0, -3, 1], [np.random.uniform(0.1, 0.5), 0, 0]
)
bproc.camera.add_camera_pose(cam_pose)

# Render the output
data = bproc.renderer.render()
bproc.writer.write_coco_annotations("output/", data, "scene")

Script Components Explained

Scene Setup

import blenderproc as bproc
import numpy as np

# Initialize blenderproc
bproc.init()

# Load an object
objs = bproc.loader.load_obj("path/to/model.obj")

Noise Addition

for obj in objs:
    obj.set_location(np.random.uniform(-1, 1, size=3))
    obj.set_rotation_euler(np.random.uniform(0, np.pi*2, size=3))

Lighting

light = bproc.types.Light()
light.set_location([2, -2, 2])
light.set_energy(np.random.uniform(100, 500))

Camera Alignment

cam_pose = bproc.math.build_transformation_mat(
    [0, -3, 1], [np.random.uniform(0.1, 0.5), 0, 0]
)
bproc.camera.add_camera_pose(cam_pose)

Output Rendering

data = bproc.renderer.render()
bproc.writer.write_coco_annotations("output/", data, "scene")

Debugging

BlenderProc supports real-time script visualization for debugging.

How to Create Noise

Prerequisites

Download the tutorial code:

git clone https://github.com/Faboohh/BlenderprocTutorial.git

CC Textures Dataset

blenderproc download cc_textures path/to/folder/where/to/save/materials

⚠️ This is a large dataset (~1900 folders) and may take 45+ minutes to download.

IPD Dataset Setup

Download the IPD dataset.

# Create dataset folder
mkdir bpd_datasets && cd bpd_datasets

# Create IPD folder
mkdir ipd && cd ipd

# Set environment variable
export SRC=https://huggingface.co/datasets/bop-benchmark/ipd/resolve/main

# Download required files
wget $SRC/ipd_base.zip
wget $SRC/ipd_models.zip

File Organization

Extract both ZIP files

Move folders from ipd_models.zip into the main ipd folder

Download main_v2.py from the project repository

Place main_v2.py in examples/dataset/bop_object_physics_positioning/

Running the Advanced Script

blenderproc run examples/datasets/bop_object_physics_positioning/main_v2.py \
  /data/bpc_datasets ipd resources/cctextures output_main_v2

Troubleshooting

Git Installation Error

If you encounter the error:

The git executable must be specified in one of the following ways...

Install Git:

sudo apt install git

Common Issues and Solutions

Path Issues: Always verify that file paths are correct and accessible

Environment Conflicts: Use the dedicated conda environment

Memory Issues: Large datasets may require significant RAM and storage

Network Timeouts: Retry dataset downloads if needed

Conclusion

BlenderProc provides a powerful framework for generating synthetic training data for computer vision applications. While the Sim2Real gap presents challenges, the tool's flexibility and extensive dataset support make it valuable for accelerating machine learning model development.

The key to successful synthetic data generation lies in:

Proper noise and variation introduction

Realistic lighting and camera setup

Appropriate dataset selection and preparation

Iterative refinement based on model performance

Regular debugging and visualization using BlenderProc's built-in tools will help ensure optimal results and identify potential issues early in the development process.
